**Efficient simulation of distructible environments in video games.**

The environment in the real-world is frequently modified due to natural phenomena or human intervention.  
The desire of transitioning from traditionally generated static virtual scenes to a more dynamic and interactive virtual environment is becoming ever so strong over the last decade. 
Increased obtainability of computing power; multi-core processors and advances in computer graphics research and development have made it possible to simulate destructible environments at runtime.

## Abstract

Investigation of currently popular methods for implementing destructible environments in a computer game and testing the performance of one of the methods. 
The method chosen involves the qualities of voxels and how their volumetric nature can be used to generate destructible environments. DirectX 11 API and IMGUI plugin were utilised to set up the rendering engine and experiment with voxels.
