Standard geometry does not have interiors to be interpreted.
Voxels â€“ rigid body physics
Do research to see of what I think is the most doable method and one the reasons 
is that the other ones are too complicated to do in this space of time.
 As long as I have explored those other techniques 
and I have given some justification in terms of doing them. 
Voxels would be less useful for those bending materials and more like blocky. 
Voronoi slicing, 
there are better techniques for dealing with more smother more fluid behaviour
Voxels are better for things that naturally bend themselves like bricks
This is the scene I want to show as destructible environment, 
this is the type of interactions.
 Then you can back track from that and say although 
I have looked at some techniques like these and looked at voxels 
and for these reasons believe voxels are better for this kind of situation.
